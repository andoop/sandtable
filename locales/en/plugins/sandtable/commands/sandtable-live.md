description: Implementation rehearsal (field exercise) - fully implement and verify the plan inside isolated git worktrees via parallel subagents; stop immediately on anomalies.
---

Run implementation rehearsal for the current requirement; read and follow `skills/implementation-rehearsal/SKILL.md`.

Execute:
1. Read this requirement’s `plan.md`, `prd.md`, `constraints.md`, and `state.md`; confirm mental rehearsal is already closed (otherwise run `/sandtable-mental` first).
2. Create an **independent git worktree / branch** for each rehearsal, then dispatch implementation subagents in parallel with `implementation-rehearsal-prompt.md`, requiring complete implementation with no TODOs or placeholders.
3. If any run returns `ANOMALY_FOUND` / `BLOCKED` -> verify it personally -> ask me -> fix the plan -> rehearse again.
4. If all return `DONE` -> write reports to `rehearsals/impl-<n>-<branch>.md`, update `state.md` (`impl.last=done`), and tell me I can use `/sandtable-redteam` (against the implementation) or `/sandtable-debrief`.

Iron law: every rehearsal must stay in its own worktree; stop immediately on anomalies instead of editing the plan yourself; no scope creep, no fallback logic; do not trust `DONE` without checking the real diff.

8. When done, load `skills/closing-the-loop/SKILL.md`, read `state.md`, and output the close block (skip for in-command chain steps; use status bulletin for in-chain switches). Do not run unlisted next phases except `/sandtable-autopilot` and `/sandtable-rehearse`.

## Implementation Completeness Gate

`DONE` is only the candidate's self-report. Do not enter `evaluating-rehearsals`, debrief, or EVALUATE until the completeness gate passes. After all candidates report `DONE`, the main agent must run the gate itself for simple candidates or may dispatch read-only mental/redteam-style reviewers for complex or high-risk candidates.

The gate must include:
- The main agent independently reads the current `prd.md`, `tests.md`, and `plan.md` and recomputes the structured verification baseline. Candidate-embedded baselines, coverage matrices, or TODO tables are inputs, not facts.
- Stable keys: `FRx` from PRD numbering; `PRD-AC1...n` from top-level bullets in the PRD acceptance criteria section; `MUST-1...n` and `MNOT-1...n` from top-level MUST / MUST NOT bullets; `TCx` from tests; `PLAN Tx/step x` from every checkbox in `plan.md`, preserving decimal step numbers.
- Body hash: normalize each item as UTF-8 text, LF newlines, trim trailing whitespace, preserve internal order and indentation semantics, then compute SHA-256. Any added, removed, renamed, changed, or missing-hash FR/PRD-AC/MUST/MNOT/TC/PLAN checkbox changes the baseline.
- The gate conclusion records review time, candidate worktree/branch, the current three-document structured baseline, and a real diff or changed-file-list summary. Do not use impl report mtime, coarse prose summaries, or id sets alone for staleness.
- Check the coverage matrix and live execution TODO table against the real diff / changed file list. Empty diff, missing planned file families, no main-agent diff check, omitted keys, aggregate keys, unsupported `not-applicable`, `missing`, or `blocked` all fail the gate.

Each candidate `DONE` report must include:
- Coverage matrix: PRD `FRx`, PRD acceptance `PRD-ACx`, PRD redlines `MUST-x/MNOT-x`, TESTS `TCx`, and PLAN `Tx/step x`, each with status and evidence. Do not replace checkbox-level PLAN coverage with task-level summaries.
- Live execution TODO table with `item` / `source` / `status` / `evidence`; items use `PRD FRx`, `PRD-ACx`, `MUST-x`, `MNOT-x`, `TCx`, or `PLAN Tx/step x`; status is only `done`, `not-applicable`, `blocked`, or `missing`. This table lives inside the candidate report only; it does not create a separate TODO file or replace `plan.md` / `state.md`.
- The matrix and TODO table must have matching PRD FR, PRD-AC, MUST/MNOT, TC, and PLAN step key sets. Conflicts use the finer-grained `missing` / `blocked` result.
